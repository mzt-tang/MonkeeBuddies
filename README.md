This is a Ionic React app I created for a 3rd year assignment. The assignment required you to create an app that included some IoT use.

This app is a social media/game app that gives you a virtual monkey/primate buddy that you can interact with.
The IoT part of the app is allowing you add friends via a QR code and scanning it with a camera.

The backend of the users stored as well as the monkey images + stats are stored using Firebase.

Below is a video demonstration of the app.
